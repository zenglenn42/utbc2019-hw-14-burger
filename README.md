Are you a burger-lover?
Does the scale of that love cause a yearning for burger consumption management?

This entirely silly application will do that.

* It allows you to create a description of a burger you'd like to eat.
* Add that burger to a list.
* Move the burger to the 'Devoured' list at the press of a button.

Your burger lists are persisted through a mysql database on a server.
